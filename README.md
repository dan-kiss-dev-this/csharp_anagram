Anagram
An anagram is a word that you can rearrange the letters and it becomes a new word. For example, "bread" is an anagram of "beard". Create a console app, where a user can input a single word and a list of other words that may be anagrams. After submitting the form, the user should be told which of the list of words were anagrams. Start by writing specs before writing any code.

The Array.Sort() method may come in handy, so try it out in the REPL to see exactly what it does.

Next, modify the method to handle partial matches â€” in other words, 'hat' should match 'path'.

Here are the requirements for this application:

Use TDD and the RGR workflow to develop your business logic.
